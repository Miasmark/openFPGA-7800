// The ARSC asset window: the appended BupChip resources, captured out of the
// cartridge download and served to the ARM from DDR3.
//
// The block is 212 KiB for Rikki & Vikki, which is why it lives in DDR3 rather
// than M10K. It is read-only to the ARM and is published only after the whole
// download has landed, so the firmware can never read a half-written asset.
//
// Bytes arrive on clk_sys and are consumed on clk_arm, so the capture side
// packs a 64-bit word and hands it across with a toggle handshake - the same
// shape arm_mapper_memory uses for its ROM shadow, for the same reason: a
// byte-rate CDC would be both slower and harder to reason about.
//
// The read side is a small direct-mapped cache with 32-byte lines, filled by a
// four-beat burst. That shape is chosen by how CoreTone reads: sixteen voices
// each walk their own sample sequentially, so reads are sequential *within* a
// voice and scattered *across* them. A single line would be thrashed sixteen
// ways and every read would become a DDR3 round trip; sixteen lines keep a line
// per voice, and a 32-byte line turns roughly eight round trips into one.
//
// This matters more on hardware than in any model: the MiSTer DDR3 window is
// shared with the HPS, so its latency is both high and variable, and a render
// that misses the 240 Hz deadline empties the PCM FIFO and drops audio.
