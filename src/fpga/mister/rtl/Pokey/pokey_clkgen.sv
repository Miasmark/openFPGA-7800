// On the die the PHI2 pad feeds an inverter chain that produces two
// non-overlapping phases o1 and o2, plus the buffered Phi2B and the PreS01
// precharge strobe that the read bus uses.

//        PHI2 --->o->--+--->o->--- o1
//                      |
//                      +--->o->--- o2      (delayed so the two never overlap)
//                      |

// Departure from the pin contract, deliberate

// The real part has one PHI2 pin and derives both phases inside. This module
// takes both phase enables from outside instead. The reason is that the host
// already has them: cart.sv runs POKEY from pclk0 and pclk1, which are the
// two halves of the same 1.79 MHz clock the real PHI2 pin carries. Rebuilding
// o1 and o2 from a single strobe would mean guessing a delay in clk_sys
// cycles and would add skew that the real chip does not have.
//
// The contract this module enforces instead: ph1_en and ph2_en are single
// clk_sys cycle strobes and are never high together. Everything downstream
// relies on that, so it is checked here rather than assumed.
