// Source: PokeyReSchem-13.pdf page 7, Jorge Cwik's
// reconstruction from the die. Atari's own sheets 35-41 in
// pokey.pdf use the same cell numbers, so the two can be
// diffed against each other and against this file.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Atari's notation, from the original legend
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `pokey.pdf` page 46 is Atari's own cell library sheet -
// the one Cwik redrew as his page 7 - and it carries the legend that decodes
// two marks that are otherwise easy to misread:
//
//     A. X INDICATES NO COUPLER ON THAT INPUT.
//     B. NUMBER INDICATES CLOCK PHASE OF INPUT COUPLERS.
//
// So an **X is not a no-connect and not an option**. It marks an input that
// bypasses the clock coupler: a direct, static, asynchronous input to a gate
// whose other inputs are phase clocked. The connection is real. Options are
// drawn separately and labelled in words - "OPTION 1 (ADD THIS LINE)" on Cell
// 22, "(Option 1 Remove this line)" on Cell 24.
//
// And the **number inside a gate is the clock phase of its input couplers**,
// not an instance number. An unnumbered gate is a plain static gate. Atari's
// own sheets write these as 1A/2A/1G/2G; Cwik kept the digit and dropped the
// letter, which is why they read as instance numbers. Two consequences worth
// keeping in mind while reading any sheet:
//
//   - the phase structure of the whole design is written on the drawing, and
//     counting numbered gates along a path counts coupler stages;
//   - a gate with one coupled and one direct input is doing something in time,
//     not just in logic. NOR(A coupled, ~A direct) is not a constant - it is an
//     edge detector, because the coupled input still holds the previous phase.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Transparent latches
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Several cells here are latches on the die: while the enable is high the
// output follows the input, and the logic they feed settles inside that same
// window. Cell 2 is the clearest case; the shift cells' SET and R are another.
//
// `clk` runs many cycles per clock enable, and that is what makes this easy. A
// latch is a plain register clocked on `clk` and gated by the enable as a
// LEVEL:
//
//     always_ff @(posedge clk) if (ld) node <= d;
//
// While `ld` is high the register re-samples every cycle, so the output follows
// the input the way the die's latch does, and it keeps the last value when the
// level falls. Nothing is combinational from `d` to `q`, so a feedback path is
// not a loop: it iterates once per `clk` cycle and settles inside the window,
// which is how it settles on the die through gate delay.
//
// Two things follow, and both are requirements on the parent rather than on the
// cell:
//
//   1. `ld` must be the LEVEL the sheet draws, not a one-cycle strobe. A
//      one-cycle enable turns the cell back into an ordinary flop and hands
//      every same-window consumer the previous window's value. That was the
//      poly5 bug.
//   2. A consumer inside the window reads the cell one `clk` cycle after the
//      window opens. That is the die's propagation delay, and it stays well
//      inside the same target phase, so nothing at the pins moves.
//
// One trap, found the hard way. A register gated by the level captures its
// input as it stood during that cycle - the pre-update value - which is the
// right one. Anything else the die reads inside the same window has to be
// sampled WITH the window for the same reason, because the enable that opens
// the window is often the same enable that clocks what the consumer reads.
//
// And one hard limit, measured rather than reasoned. A window may cover at most
// ONE phase of the target clock, and a cell whose own output feeds back
// INVERTED - a toggle, `d = ~q` - must keep a single-cycle enable whatever the
// sheet draws. A settling loop converges inside a wide window; an inverting one
// never does. Six timer pulses through a toggle with a phase-wide enable gave
// eighteen flips and collapsed the divide by two. The die does not have this
// problem because a toggle there is master-slave, two latches on opposite
// non-overlapping phases, so it flips once per target clock however long each
// phase lasts. A single-cycle enable is that master-slave pair collapsed, and
// is the right model for those sites.
//
// Cell numbers are Atari's and are kept verbatim so a reviewer can hold the
// PDF next to the code.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// How the dynamic circuit maps onto an FPGA
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// POKEY is two-phase dynamic logic. A storage node is a pass transistor into a
// pair of inverters, with a second pass transistor on the complement of the
// same control feeding the node back on itself:
//
//        D --| Ld |--o--->o->--->o->--+     write when Ld
//                    |                |
//                    +---| Ld_n |-----+     hold when Ld is low
//
// The complement input exists only to hold the node. A flip-flop already holds
// when its enable is low, so every `Ld_n`, `WR_n`, `CR_n` and `REC` that serves
// only as a keeper collapses into the enable being low. Where a complement
// does real work (the shift cells recirculate rather than merely hold) it is
// kept as a port.
//
// Every cell here is `always_ff @(posedge clk)` with an enable. No latches, no
// negedge, no generated clocks. Phase separation comes from ph1_en/ph2_en never
// being high in the same clk cycle - see pokey_clkgen.sv.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Which of these are actually instantiated
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// All 21, each where its sheet instantiates it:
//
//   1   pots, kbd, serial      12  audio, chan, irq
//   2   chan, kbd, serial      15  serial
//   3   kbd                    16  serial
//   4   kbd                    17  serial
//   5   audio, chan, irq,      20  chan
//       serial                 21  bus
//   6   kbd                    22  bus
//   7   bus                    23  pots
//   8   pots, the ALLPOT       24  chan
//       diagonal - its only    25  serial
//       use in the chip        26  pots
//   9   irq, poly
//   11  chan
//
// Numbers 10, 13, 14, 18 and 19 are absent from Atari's own library, so they
// are not gaps here either.
//
// Read polarity is not uniform and matters. The internal read bus is precharged
// and drivers pull it down, so the cells that drive it invert. Cell 1, Cell 8,
// Cell 9 and Cell 12 output the complement; Cell 5 does not. That asymmetry is
// on the schematic, not a transcription slip.

// Stores D on Ld and drives the read bus while Rd is high.
//
// The read tap sits between the two inverters, so it carries the complement of
// what was stored - but it drives the *gate* of a grounded pull down, and the
// Rd pass gate connects that pull down to the pin. The driver inverts again,
// so a precharged bus sees the stored value, and the pin is labelled plain Q
// on the drawing. Cell 9's pin is drawn with an overbar precisely because
// there the input reaches the gate directly and is inverted only once.
//
// An earlier version of this cell counted the tap and not the driver and
// handed out the complement, which would have inverted every byte read through
// it. Nothing was wired to it at the time.

//     Cell 3 (TYPE 1)   takes T1, emits T2

// 20 takes three: the same NOR, then a NOR used as an inverter with its Ld
// input crossed out on the drawing, then NOR(Ld, BOR). Same function, longer
// path. Page 5 alternates the two along a row to balance the ripple, so in RTL
// they are one body under two names, kept apart so a reviewer can match the
// drawing box for box.
//
// The complement is where they genuinely differ:
//
//     Cell 20            BOR = ~BOR
//     Cell 24            BOR = NOR(BOR, Ld)
//     Cell 24 Option 1   BOR = ~BOR            "(Option 1: Remove this line)"
//
// Option 1 makes Cell 24's complement behave like Cell 20's during a load.
// Page 5 puts Option 1 at the top bit of every AUDF counter, which is the bit
// whose complement leaves the row.
//
// `~Ld` in the borrow is a guard, not arithmetic. On the die Ld comes back
// from the underflow through several gates and a delay element, so it lands
// well after the CR pulse that caused it and the two are never true together
// during a real borrow. It is written out because the drawing has three NOR
// inputs, and the parent keeps them apart in time the way the die does.
