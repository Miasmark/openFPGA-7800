// What the schematic shows
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Each poly is a two-phase dynamic shift register. A bit is an inverter marked
// "2" followed by one marked "1", the o2 stage then the o1 stage, so a pair of
// triangles on the drawing is one bit. Feedback is an XNOR, drawn with the
// double curved input, not an XOR:
//
//   +--> [2][1] --> [2][1] --> [2][1] --> [2][1] --> poly4Out
//   |                              |          |
//   |                              +--XNOR----+
//   +------------------------------+
//
// The 4 bit taps stages 3 and 4. That reading is confirmed twice over: MAME's
// poly_init_4_5 XNORs exactly those two taps, and the AtariAge tap thread
// gives 3 and 5 for the 5 bit.
//
// The feedback polarity differs between the polys, and so does the state Init
// parks them in. Getting this backwards leaves a counter stuck forever.
//
//   4 and 5 bit   XNOR feedback, Init parks the register at zero
//   17/9 bit      XNOR feedback, Init seeds it and then holds bit 16 low so it
//                 drains to zero; the RANDOM drivers invert, hence $FF
//
// The spec's "the counter is set to all ones state, therefore the CPU will
// read $FF" is about the 17 bit, which RANDOM reads. It does not describe the
// 4 and 5 bit, and applying it to them wedges both.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The 17 bit is not a plain shift register
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// It shifts right, and the feedback is injected into the middle of the chain
// rather than at the end:
//
//   bit0 -> wraps to bit16
//   bit8 ^ bit13 -> inserted at bit7
//
// That mid-chain injection is why RANDOM's "high order 8 bits" is bits 15..8
// and not the last eight stages. The 9 bit variant is the same idea with the
// feedback at bit0 ^ bit5 landing at bit8.
//
// From the CO12294 spec, confirmed on the page image rather than through the
// OCR: out of init the counter is all ones and the CPU reads $FF from RANDOM.
//
// The polys are clocked at the full 1.79 MHz, always. The audio channels
// sample them at their own divider rate, which is what makes each channel
// appear to own a poly running at its frequency. Getting this backwards - and
// clocking the polys per channel - is the single most common POKEY error.
