// MOS 6502 datapath: the four internal buses and every register hanging off
// them. Structure follows the visual6502 netlist.
//
// Why this is worth building as the real thing rather than as an ALU with a
// state machine around it: the awkward behaviour a 6502 core has to get right
// is mostly structural. The unfixed high byte on cycle 4 of abs,X falls out
// of ADL/ADH being separate buses with one adder between them. ROR's carry-in
// falls out of SB bit 7 having its own control line. $01xx and $FFxx fall out
// of forcing bits low against a precharged bus. None of that needs a special
// case here, because the wires are the ones the die has.
//
// Phases: every register is clocked by clk_sys and gated by phi1_en or
// phi2_en, whichever phase the silicon's latch is transparent on.
